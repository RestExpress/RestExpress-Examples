This kickstart project illustrates how to create a simple RestExpress project.  Complete with Ant
build, it contains a skeleton main() class, RestServer, and an empty, but functional service.

Alternatively, there is a kickstart zip file generated in the release process.  Simply:

1) Unzip the file.
2) Run ant to build it.
3) 'ant run' to run it.

Then:

1) Change the Routes.java file to match your URL requirements using the using the RouteBuilder DSL.
2) Implement the functionality for those URLs in a service class, much like KickstartService.java
   does.
3) Impress your superiors with the speed at which you've completed your tasks.
