BLOGGING EXAMPLE APPLICATION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application supports the concept of a blog, blog entry, and blog entry comment, in hierarchical
fashion.  Which is roughly the concepts that a blogging system like WordPress supports.  One could
use these RESTful services to create a blogging system.

This is a fully functional RestExpress application that utilizes the sub-projects, Syntaxe and
RepoExpress for domain validation and object persistence, respectively.  It also utilizes the 
MongoDB ObjectId as the ID for the persisted objects, which illustrates how to install your own
object ID converters for persistence and XML and JSON marshaling.

Additionally, the project illustrates how to map exceptions that are non-runtime exceptions
(checked exceptions) into ServiceExceptions that RestExpress knows how to translate into an HTTP
response.

To run it, install and start MongoDB, then type 'mvn clean package exec:java'.

The URL '/console/routes' will show you the routes available in the application
(e.g. curl -i localhost:8081/console/routes.xml).  Or simply look in the Routes.java file.
